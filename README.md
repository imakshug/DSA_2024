# Daily Dose of DSA

Every day, I dive into LeetCode problems to refine my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) skills. I tackle these challenges using both C++ and Python, which helps me stay versatile and deepen my understanding of various concepts.

## What I Work On
üîç **C++ Challenges:** I use C++ for its efficiency and powerful features, tackling problems that involve:

- **Algorithms:** Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms
- **Data Structures:** Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hash Tables, Trees, Graphs

üêç **Python Problems:** Python‚Äôs simplicity and readability are perfect for exploring:

- **Algorithms:** Recursive Algorithms, Backtracking, Divide and Conquer, Bit Manipulation
- **Data Structures:** Heaps, Priority Queues, Tries, Union-Find

I focus on solving many problems from easy to hard to challenge myself and improve my problem-solving skills continuously.
